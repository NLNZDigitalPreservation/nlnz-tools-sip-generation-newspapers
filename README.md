# National Library of New Zealand Tools SIP Generation for Wairarapa Times files

Internally, documentation is found in the `docs` subfolder.  The Wairarapa Times script follows the same logic as the SipGeneration for Fairfax script, with some changes with the way that the filenames are processed, i.e. Wairarapa Times filenames do not contain section codes and the date formatting differs.  The remainder of the documentation relating to Fairfax remains valid.
